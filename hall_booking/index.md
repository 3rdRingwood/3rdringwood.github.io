Important Notice re Covid-19. The hall is deep-cleaned a minimum of once a week with all surfaces dusted, vacuumed and 'fogged' with an appropriate anti-viral disinfectant. However, all hall users are responsible for ensuring that frequently touched surfaces (e.g. light switches, door handles, toilets, etc.) are cleaned to their own satisfaction before and after use of the hall. All bins must be emptied and rubbish removed from the site as there is no waste collection. Users must leave the hall in a clean and tidy condition for the next user and extra time should be allowed for this.
