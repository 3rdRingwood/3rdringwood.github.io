### Data Protection, Confidentiality and Privacy Policy

#### Who is this for and what does it apply to?

The current Data Protection (DP) regulations were updated in May 2018 to be consistent with European legislation known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Data Protection regulation applies to all organisations that hold any information that identifies living people.

DP rules do not apply to organisations holding only organisation data, with no names attached and the rules do not apply to individuals holding address books or, for example, Christmas Card lists on computer.

In Scouts, DP applies to the lists of young people, adults and any other people recorded in a structured way for their future contact. It applies to the use of the Compass membership system from recruitment onwards and Online Scout Manager (OSM). It applies to information gathered from the website, to activity information forms and fundraising list information. It does not apply to incidental naming of people in, for example, minutes of meetings or action lists.
